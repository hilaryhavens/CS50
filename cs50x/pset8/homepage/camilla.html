        <h2><i>Camilla</i></h2>
        <br>
        <p><i>Camilla</i> (1796) was Burney's third novel and the one for which she received the most pay because it was published by subscription.  Fun fact: the subscription list to <i>Camilla</i> was one of the two places that Jane Austen's name appeared in her lifetime.  <i>Camilla</i> is a bildungsroman about the extended Tyrold family and their paths to marriage.</p>
